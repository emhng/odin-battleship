## Project Objectives

Using the test driven development process, create a battleship game.

Your game must include the following:

- Use factory functions for ships, gameboards, and players.
- A CPU for the player to play against

## Learnings

Following the project brief on being selective on what factory function or module each function should go under was good practice. I feel like I have a better understanding of how to organize my code now.
